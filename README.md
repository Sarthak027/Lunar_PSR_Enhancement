## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing the visibility of **low-light lunar crater images** using deep learning techniques. By implementing a **Convolutional Autoencoder**, we aim to improve the quality of images captured by lunar missions like Chandrayaan-2, especially in Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs).

---

## üåü Features

- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Implemented using a Convolutional Autoencoder.
- **Low-Light Image Simulation**: Generate low-light images and train the model to enhance them.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize bounding boxes on images and model predictions.
- **Model Training**: Train and validate the model on lunar crater images.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate the model and visualize training progress.
